# Unhandled Asynchronous Operations in Firebase Cloud Functions

This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in Firebase Cloud Functions: improper handling of asynchronous operations.  Failing to correctly manage asynchronous calls (promises or async/await) can lead to unexpected results and make debugging a challenge.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Problem

Asynchronous operations, such as database reads or external API calls, are fundamental to Firebase Functions.  If not handled correctly (using promises or async/await), your function might continue execution before these operations complete, leading to unexpected null or undefined values.
