In a Firebase project, when using Cloud Functions, an uncommon error might arise if you have asynchronous operations within your functions that aren't properly handled. For instance, if you have a function that fetches data from a database and then performs further operations based on that data, forgetting to use promises or async/await can lead to unexpected behavior. The function might return before the database operation completes, resulting in undefined or stale data being used. This can cause inconsistencies and errors that are hard to debug. For example:
```javascript
exports.myFunction = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  const snapshot = await admin.firestore().collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').get();
  const myData = snapshot.data();
  // Incorrect way to use myData before it is populated
  console.log('My data: ', myData);
  // ... further operations using myData ...
});
```
This is because the `snapshot.data()` might return null or an empty object if the database operation is still pending when the next line runs.  Another example is improper error handling within a chain of asynchronous operations, which will be harder to trace back.
